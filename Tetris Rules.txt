RULES:
-Use the right and left arrow keys to move a piece right and left
-Use the up arrow key to rotate a piece

-Press space to immediately drop a piece to the bottom of the board
-Press C to "hold a piece"
When the game starts, choose an initial speed you want the pieces to drop at(1-5, 1 being
slowest and 5 being faster). As you start, your score will be zero, but gain points by
clearing lines(more per lines in 1 clear) and dropping pieces. As your score gets higher
your speed will aso increase. Once the pieces hit the "top" the game will end, and you can
either choose to play again or to exit the program.
